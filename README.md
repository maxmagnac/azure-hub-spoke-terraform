Azure Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology

A hands-on Azure networking project demonstrating a hub-and-spoke virtual network architecture using Azure VNet Peering. This project establishes a central hub VNet connected to two spoke VNets, enabling controlled and scalable network segmentation in the cloud.

Architecture Overview

| Component | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|
| hub-vnet | Azure Virtual Network | Central connectivity hub |
| spoke1-vnet | Azure Virtual Network | Workload segment 1 |
| spoke2-vnet | Azure Virtual Network | Workload segment 2 |
| spoke1-to-hub | VNet Peering | Spoke 1 to Hub peering link |
| hub-to-spoke1 | VNet Peering | Hub to Spoke 1 peering link |
| spoke2-to-hub | VNet Peering | Spoke 2 to Hub peering link |
| hub-to-spoke2 | VNet Peering | Hub to Spoke 2 peering link |

Peering Configuration

Azure VNet Peering requires two peering links per connection - one from each side. This project configures all four links with the following settings:

Hub to Spoke 1
- Allow hub-vnet to access spoke1-vnet ✅
- Forward traffic from spoke1-vnet to hub-vnet ⬜
- Gateway or route server forwarding ⬜
- Remote gateway or route server ⬜

Hub to Spoke 2
- Allow hub-vnet to access spoke2-vnet ✅
- Forward traffic from spoke2-vnet to hub-vnet` ⬜
- Gateway or route server forwarding ⬜
- Remote gateway or route server ⬜

Key Concepts

Hub-and-Spoke Topology
A hub-and-spoke architecture places a central hub VNet as the shared services and connectivity layer. Each spoke VNet connects to the hub, allowing controlled communication across workload segments without direct spoke-to-spoke peering.

Azure VNet Peering
VNet Peering connects two Azure virtual networks, making them function as a single network for connectivity purposes. Peering operates at low latency over the Microsoft backbone network without requiring gateways or encrypted tunnels.

Bidirectional Peering Links
Each peered connection requires two peering links - one initiated from each VNet. Both links must reach a Connected and Fully Synchronized state for traffic to flow correctly.

Technologies Used
