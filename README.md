# Azure Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology

A hands-on Azure networking project demonstrating a hub-and-spoke virtual network
architecture using Azure VNet Peering. This project establishes a central hub VNet
connected to two spoke VNets, enabling controlled and scalable network segmentation
in the cloud.

Architecture Overview
Component	Type	Role
hub-vnet	Azure Virtual Network	Central connectivity hub
spoke1-vnet	Azure Virtual Network	Workload segment 1
spoke2-vnet	Azure Virtual Network	Workload segment 2
spoke1-to-hub	VNet Peering	Spoke 1 to Hub peering link
hub-to-spoke1	VNet Peering	Hub to Spoke 1 peering link
spoke2-to-hub	VNet Peering	Spoke 2 to Hub peering link
hub-to-spoke2	VNet Peering	Hub to Spoke 2 peering link
Peering Configuration
Azure VNet Peering requires two peering links per connection - one from each side. This project configures all four links with the following settings:

Hub to Spoke 1
Allow hub-vnet to access spoke1-vnet ✅
Forward traffic from spoke1-vnet to hub-vnet ⬜
Gateway or route server forwarding ⬜
Remote gateway or route server ⬜
Hub to Spoke 2
Allow hub-vnet to access spoke2-vnet ✅
Forward traffic from spoke2-vnet to hub-vnet ⬜
Gateway or route server forwarding ⬜
Remote gateway or route server ⬜

Key Concepts
Hub-and-Spoke Topology A hub-and-spoke architecture places a central hub VNet as the shared services and connectivity layer. Each spoke VNet connects to the hub, allowing controlled communication across workload segments without direct spoke-to-spoke peering.

Azure VNet Peering VNet Peering connects two Azure virtual networks, making them function as a single network for connectivity purposes. Peering operates at low latency over the Microsoft backbone network without requiring gateways or encrypted tunnels.

Bidirectional Peering Links Each peered connection requires two peering links - one initiated from each VNet. Both links must reach a Connected and Fully Synchronized state for traffic to flow correctly.
